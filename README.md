# pogoplug-v4-bodhi-rootfs-debian
bodhi's Debian rootfs, prepared specifically for the Pogoplug.

## Rationale

User 'bodhi' at http://forum.doozan.com has prepared a Debian rootfs tarball for use with many small ARM machines.

However, his release still requires a few additional steps in order to prepare it for the Pogoplug.

This github repository aims to provide versions of his rootfs which are fully ready to be used with Pogoplug V4 devices (Pogoplug Mobile and Pogoplug Series 4).
